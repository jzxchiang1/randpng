NOTE: Please use Python3!

Make a virtualenv on your machine and run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

Simply run `python make_random_bitmap.py`, which will generate a rand.png file in the same directory.

Note that replying 'n' to the initial prompt will rely on lesser randomnization tools to generate the
bitmap without accessing www.random.org's API.

Thanks!
